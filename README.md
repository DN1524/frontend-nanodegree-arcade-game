# Classic Arcade Game Project

The game is played using the directional arrows on your keyboard.

The goal of this game is to dodge the bugs passing by and make it to the water or boat to score as many points as you can before 1 minute passes.

- If you lose all 3 lives, it's GameOver.
- If you survive before 1 minute passes, you win! (You could just stand there for a minute and win but what's the fun in that?)
- Water tiles = 50 points
- Boat = 250 points
- All bugs in the game have random speeds and randomly changes directions going from right to left or left to right.
- All bugs randomly change color, but the color is just for looks. It does NOT change the bug in any way.

NOTE: This is not the final version of the game.
